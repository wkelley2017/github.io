                    Growing up in Austin and having been born into a family of musicians it was natural for me to spend thirty years on the road, on stage, and in music schools.
                     Along the way, a naturallove of languages and logic led to programming and coding. The design of engaging and interactive sites and applications is what 
                     occupies my energies today.Perhaps you can learn something by checking out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio Page</a>. If you have an questions be sure to <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>.

                </p>
                <p>I love programming, languages, music challenging puzzles and tasks, but I also have a tremendous background in raw physical labour and outdoor activities.
                     I've worked all levels in foodservice as well as construction industries, from the bottom up to and including management and supervisory roles,
                      so I have an appreciation for an effective chain of command as well as a positive and patient attitude toward peers and customers.

                    Seems hard to believe today, but I first laid my hands on an Apple computer in central Austin in 1980.In a marketplace flooded with developers,
                     my unique offering is a highly evolved and varied aesthetic sense, tinged with humor and warmth.
